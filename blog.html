                <hr>

                <p>
                 
                  Breeding and caring for camels among Saudis is very important because it has many benefits, as it provides energy and nutrients and also produces milk and meat. One of the strong sources of income that helps the country to develop in animal production and increase its financial income. The price of camel milk and the price of camel meat reach high prices compared to goat and cow milk because camel milk contains good nutritional elements. Camels are also raised according to certain standards. Camel breeding is caring for camel food, providing a good amount of water, providing a suitable place for camel breeding, caring for camel hygiene
                  The goal of camel breeding must be determined. Are camels raised for the production and sale of milk and meat? Here, a diet and breeding system must be provided based on improving and increasing camel production of milk and meat. It is different from the system of raising camels for the purpose of producing milk and meat, so they are different in the way of feeding and training, as well as how to take care of them
                  Many people raise and care for camels in many places, and many breeders depend on raising them to produce milk and meat in order to feed on them and also sell them, and the price of camel milk and the price of camel meat reach high prices compared to the milk of goats and cows because of what camel milk contains Good nutritional elements, and camels are raised according to certain standards that are different from raising cows. Among the most important information about the method of raising camels is the following:
                  Taking care of camel food
                     Provide a good amount of water
                     Giving a prize to camels after each training process
                     Provide a suitable place for breeding camels
                       Pay attention to camel hygiene</p>

                  Camels are characterized by the fact that they bear heat and thirst and can bear hunger, and they are considered among the animals with a stronger endurance than other animals, such as their endurance to walk long distances, and they also bear to live in different places, which helps to reduce the costs of their accommodation, such as they sleep under trees and anywhere compared to other animals
                  Camels produce many profitable sources such as milk and meat. Fabrics and clothes are also manufactured. Camel milk is produced, which is considered high in price compared to other types of milk such as cows and sheep. The price of camels is also high compared to other milk-producing animals.
                    There are types of camels that are raised for the purpose of competitions, and they are usually hybrid animals, and the prices of these hybrid camels reach higher prices than camels that produce milk and meat, and some types of camels are used for the beauty of their shape
                  Camels are among the animals that have a good mood compared to other animals, as they are less affected in terms of exposure to intimidation and disturbing and frightening sounds.

                  The nutritional needs of camels are low compared to other animals, as camels are distinguished by their high efficiency in benefiting from food, especially from fodder that is poor in its nutritional content.
                  The animal suffices a quantity of food within the range of 1.25% of the body weight to cover the preservative nutritional needs, which is equivalent to about 12.5 grams of ingested dry matter per kilogram of body weight. It must be taken into consideration that this amount should be increased by 25% when the camels go out to graze, in exchange for the effort exerted by the animals. during grazing. During pregnancy, nutritional needs must be increased by 20% during the first 8 months, and the increase reaches 50% during the last 4 months of pregnancy, between which it is taken into account that camels obtain twice their preservative needs during the first 6 months of milk.
                  Good and decreases to one and a half times the preservative needs during the second 6 months. The quantities eaten from natural pastures depend on the type of available vegetation, the percentage of moisture, the degree of palatability, and the daily grazing hours counter. It was found that the amount of dry matter eaten from good pasture for one animal is about 6 kg per day, up to about 12 kg in the case of high predominance of juicy plant species. Taste, and decreases to about 1.5 kg in the case of the dominance of saline and thorny plant species.
                  The camel has gained its reputation as the ship of the desert since ancient times due to its superior ability to withstand thirst for long periods. The length of the thirst endurance period depends on the nutritional content of pasture plants, the percentage of moisture in them, the concentration of salts in drinking water, the season of the year, and the physiological condition of the camel (pregnancy - birth - milk - growth). And camels have the ability to drink water in large quantities and at a very fast rate. One animal can drink 10-15 liters of water per minute, and it can also drink water equivalent to a third of its weight after long periods of thirst.
                  Camels have the ability to drink salty water with a concentration that may reach 20,000 parts per million, which is equivalent to more than half of the salinity concentration in sea water.
                  It is necessary to know how to feed camels, what foods they want and what they need. Breeders prefer to provide traditional food for camels, which is what they feed on in their original place, such as Bermuda grass and alfalfa. Nutrients in the food, which leads to meeting the needs of the camel in terms of the nutrients it needs </p>
